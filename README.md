###### You :"How are you gonna do this ? "
  Me : "I know its difficult but interesting too.. what I came up with is we have to find all the feature which Anime face carries.
  like Face shape : {'Round' , 'square', 'triangular','more'}, eyes type , nose type, expression, hair type, and combining them will create a anime face character. "
###### You "cool, sounds interesting "
  Me : ":D yeah but Problem is it will be very difficult to train the algorithm if we use machine learning So will try an anlternative simple solution in the start. If you have any better Idea share with me at anandpathak69@gmail.com or create an issue.. I think if we work together we can do this ;)"
###### You "Can I get closer look to your algorithm"
  Me : "Sure! just email me I will send you the algorithm"
